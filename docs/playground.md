# Playground

A simple way to try KubeMQ without installing it!

Playground is the fastest way to try KubeMQ functionality without downloading and installing it. It is hosted on our cloud and runs just like a regular KubeMQ would.

Access KubeMQ hosted playground with address: `https://playground.kubemq.io`
